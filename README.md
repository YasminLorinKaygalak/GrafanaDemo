2. Consul Service-to-Service Dashboard: Focuses on monitoring service interactions, including TCP metrics, traffic patterns, request success rates, and response times. It provides visibility into service-to-service communication and ensures smooth operation of services within the mesh.

3. Consul Service Dashboard: Provides detailed monitoring of Envoy proxies at the cluster and service levels, tracking key metrics like request success rates, resource usage, and connectivity. This dashboard is essential for ensuring the performance and reliability of individual services.

These dashboards are essential tools for ensuring the stability, efficiency, and reliability of your service mesh environment.
